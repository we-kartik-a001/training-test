* Model
- It include all the database code.
- Models are used to fetch, insert, update, and delete data.

* View
- Represents the UI (User Interface) — basically, what the user sees.
- It includes the frontend code. 

* Controller 
- Call model and insert data into the view. 
- Acts as the middleman between Model and View.

* Route 
- Decide whihc controller will handle a request. 
- A route connects a URL to a specific controller method, view, or logic.


* Version control is like a save game feature for your work.

- Every time you make a change (like writing a new paragraph or fixing a mistake), it saves that version.

- If you mess up later, you can go back to an earlier version — like hitting "undo" but way more powerful.

- If you’re working with friends, version control helps everyone work together without accidentally ruining each other's changes.

- You can also make a copy (called a "branch") to try new ideas without messing up your main work — and if you like the changes, you can combine them later.

- Think of it like Google Docs, where you can see all the edits and who made them — but for any kind of file, not just documents.
